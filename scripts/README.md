## üîß Script Development Guidelines

### Adding New Scripts

1. **Choose the right directory:**
   - `deployment/` - Installation, setup, teardown
   - `testing/` - Test execution, validation
   - `diagnostics/` - Troubleshooting, debugging
   - `lib/` - Reusable functions

2. **Follow naming conventions:**
   - Use underscores: `my_script.sh`
   - Be descriptive: `verify_aws_permissions.sh` not `check.sh`
   - Add `.sh` extension for shell scripts
   - Add `.py` extension for Python scripts

3. **Make scripts executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/category/my_script.sh
   ```

4. **Add documentation:**
   - Update this README.md
   - Add comments in the script
   - Include usage examples

5. **Use absolute paths:**
   ```bash
   SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
   PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "${SCRIPT_DIR}/../.." && pwd)"
   ```
